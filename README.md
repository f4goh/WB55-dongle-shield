USE WB55 dongle shield with Micropython

Using MicroPython in high school offers three key benefits. First, it's simple and lightweight, making it ideal for students to learn programming concepts on microcontrollers like the STM32WB55.
Second, it enables real-time experimentation with hardware, helping students bridge the gap between software and electronics. Finally, MicroPython's syntax is similar to Python, which many students already know, allowing them to quickly apply their knowledge to embedded systems.

The shield for the STM32WB55 dongle offers several advantages, particularly for laptop-based projects. It includes an OLED display, LM57 and DS18S20 temperature sensors, an LDR resistive light sensor, a push button, and an RGB WS2812b LED, providing a versatile range of components for hands-on experimentation. This setup allows students to explore various IoT and embedded applications, from environmental sensing to interactive feedback displays. Additionally, the compact dongle design connects easily to a laptop, making it highly portable and convenient for students to program and test in real time.
