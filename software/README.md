The `.mpy` files are **bytecode files** in Python primarily used in **MicroPython** and other Python environments for microcontrollers. They serve a specific purpose for optimizing memory usage and performance on devices with limited resources. Here are their main uses:

### 1. **Reducing File Size**
   `.mpy` files contain **compiled bytecode** (rather than plain text source code), making them more compact than standard `.py` files. This is crucial on microcontrollers where memory space is often restricted.

### 2. **Faster Execution**
   `.mpy` files avoid on-the-fly compilation. Instead of compiling Python source code every time it runs, the bytecode is ready to be directly interpreted by the Python virtual machine, speeding up execution.

### 3. **Conserving Memory Resources**
   In an environment with limited **RAM and ROM**, `.mpy` bytecode files use less memory than standard source code, as MicroPython loads the bytecode directly rather than dealing with a larger text file.

### 4. **Source Code Protection**
   Since they donâ€™t contain directly readable source code, `.mpy` files provide a layer of protection for the code. This can be useful for distributing code without exposing the internal logic in plain text.

### Usage Example
   In a MicroPython environment, an `.mpy` file can be generated using the **`mpy-cross`** compiler provided with MicroPython. This compiles a Python file (`.py`) into an optimized `.mpy` file suited for devices like STM32WB55-dongle microcontrollers, and others.

to convert lm75a.py to lm75a.mpy, execute run.bat file (windows only)


```console
mpy-cross.exe lm75a.py -o lm75a.mpy -march=armv7emsp
```
